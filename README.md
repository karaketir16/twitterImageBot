search something on twitter and download photo

### What exactly does that?
  Before telling what it does, let me tell you why I wrote it. I was following a page on twitter and they was sharing exactly one phone per day. Then I wanted to download all of the photos they had shared. But, There was huge amount of photos (nearly a thousand). I search the internet, I found some programs that requare twitter api. I apply `develepor.twitter` to api access, but they didn't give.
  Then I realized that page shares every photo with text in same struct every day. for example `"Berceste beyitler - 3"` for day 3 and `"Berceste beyitler - 20"` for day 20. When I searched `"Berceste beyitler - 3"` or any other number in twitter the tweet that includes that photo I want, was the top of search reasult.  
I have wroten this code for downloads
